# Hey, I'm Yoto (he/him)! 👋 

I'm a junior at the University of California, San Diego majoring in Math-Computer Science with a minor in Cognitive Science. I have a deep passion for utilizing technology in service of others, particularly being drawn to full-stack development and machine learning. 

In my free time, I love to cook, hike, play video games with friends and play with my dogs!
